                        <p>Where exposure events that do not involve the general public occur the affected people are contacted directly by contact tracers.</p>
                        <p>Auckland:</p>
                        <p>Low risk exposure events (for example drive throughs and supermarkets) are no longer being published as the public health risk is very low. Analysis by the Ministry of Health of exposure events to date confirm no positive cases have occurred from these sorts of locations. Transmission of the virus is very low in these settings and vaccination is adding another layer of protection for communities. We will continue to publish higher risk exposure events in public spaces when they occur.</p>
                        <p>For the rest of New Zealand:</p>
                        <p>Weâ€™ll continue to publish both high and low exposure events in other parts of New Zealand because there are currently much fewer of these. Itâ€™s very important that people to continue to use the COVID Tracer App so contact tracers have access to your digital diary which speeds up the contact tracing process.</p>

                          We are facing a period of greater uncertainty and, I strongly believe, we can make a difference through tools and services like these.<br/>
                          Over the years myself and my family have been supported by the tireless, friendly, hardworking and unrelenting work of the heros within the NZ Health system. <br/>
                          This is a small token of my appreciation.</p>

                          I&apos;m Greg! A software developer in Christchurch.

                          Automatically deleting all the user information after a set amount of time is done for privacy and information security reasons. It also helps keep the service healthy.
                          That being said, if you would really like a indefinite subscription, get in touch and we can work something out
