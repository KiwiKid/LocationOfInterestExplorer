    <p>If you visited a location of interest during the relevant time, follow the health instructions provided. </p>

    <p>If required, call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 or you can record your visit online. If you record your visit online, you do not need to call Healthline – our contact tracers will call or email you.</p>

    <p>If you are required to isolate you must do so until you have spoken to Healthline. They will advise you and your household members on what you need to do.</p>

    <p>If you were not at a location of interest at the relevant time, you do not need to register your visit or be tested unless you have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

    <p>Please note that there are section 70 public health orders in place that require you to follow health orders. This also applies to household contacts for some locations (unless the contact is a vaccinated health worker or managed isolation and quarantine worker, and they meet certain criteria). </p>

    <p>Anyone who returns a positive COVID-19 test is required to enter a managed isolation facility for 14 days.</p>

    <p>If you have been contacted by a district health board, the Ministry of Health or a district health board public health unit, please follow their advice.</p>

    <p>The locations of interest map will be updated 3 times a day (8am, 12 noon and 4pm) – please see the main locations of interest page for the most recent locations.</p>

    <p>Note: not all locations can be mapped – for example bus routes – please refer to the full list of locations of interest.</p>

    <p>Exposure events</p>
    <p>Where exposure events that do not involve the general public occur the affected people are contacted directly by contact tracers.</p>

    <p>Auckland</p>

    <p>Low risk exposure events (for example drive throughs and supermarkets) are no longer being published as the public health risk is very low. Analysis by the Ministry of Health of exposure events to date confirm no positive cases have occurred from these sorts of locations. Transmission of the virus is very low in these settings and vaccination is adding another layer of protection for communities. We will continue to publish higher risk exposure events in public spaces when they occur.</p>

    <p>For the rest of New Zealand</p>

    <p>We’ll continue to publish both high and low exposure events in other parts of New Zealand because there are currently much fewer of these. It’s very important that people to continue to use the COVID Tracer App so contact tracers have access to your digital diary which speeds up the contact tracing process.</p>
