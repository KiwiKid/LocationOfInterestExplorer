# Location of Interest Explorer


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The page consists of navigable map with a Drawer at the bottom.
The drawer contains details of the items in the center of the circle.


Note:
Theres some untidy compromises made in the interests of time, such as: 
- Loose typing:
(The "LocationOfInterest" type is based on the original CSV item and could be replaced by MohLocationOfInterest)
- A poorly written readme :)

Open to PR's!
